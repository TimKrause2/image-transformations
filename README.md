# image-transformations
OpenCL image transformations with anti-aliasing
This is a Qt Creator project. Load with Qt Creator and build for your machine.
The OpenCL development files can be installed with:

sudo apt install ocl-icd-opencl-dev

and then you'll also need an ICD(Installable Client Driver). This depends on
your hardware.
